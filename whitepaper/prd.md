# Tamper-Proof Component Logistics Tracker PRD

## Project Summary
The Tamper-Proof Component Logistics Tracker is a blockchain-based system designed to provide tamper-proof logging of component handoffs in a secure supply chain. This system aims to track the custody chain of critical components from manufacturer to end user with cryptographic verification at each checkpoint, making it ideal for high-security environments such as military or medical supply chains.

## Use Case
- Track high-value components through multiple transfer points
- Verify component authenticity and handling at each checkpoint
- Prevent unauthorized substitution or tampering
- Maintain immutable record of the custody chain
- Allow authorized stakeholders to view component history
- Optionally store supporting documentation (via IPFS) for each transfer

## Target Audience
- Military logistics personnel
- Defense contractors
- Medical supply chain managers
- High-value component manufacturers
- Logistics security specialists
- Compliance auditors

## Functional Requirements

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Requirements:
1. Smart Contract
   - Register new shipments
   - Add checkpoints with location, timestamp, validator, and status
   - Query checkpoint history for a shipment
   - Basic access control

2. Frontend Dashboard
   - View all shipments
   - View checkpoint history for a selected shipment
   - Validate a checkpoint from the UI
   - Basic authentication

3. Integration
   - Connect frontend to smart contract
   - Python script to simulate checkpoints

### Stretch Goals:
1. IPFS Integration
   - Upload supporting documents (images, PDFs)
   - Store document hashes on-chain
   - Retrieve and display documents in UI

2. Enhanced Security
   - Multi-signature validation
   - Role-based access control
   - Tamper detection alerts

3. Advanced Features
   - QR code generation for physical tracking
   - Mobile app support
   - Real-time notifications
